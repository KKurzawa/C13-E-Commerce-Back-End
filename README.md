# E-Commerce Back End

## Description

As e-commerce has become become increasingly normalized as a predominant way for businesses and customers to buy and sell products, having a well devoloped back end to any commerce website is essential.   Developing this application introduced me to Sequelize and sharpened my back end development skills notably the use of Express.js and MySQL.

## Usage

When the user enters there database name, MySql username, and MySql password into a .env file the database is then connected using Sequalize.  When the user enters the schema and seeds commands the database is created and seeded with test data.  When the command to start the application is entered the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.  When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.  When the user tests API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
They are able to successfully create, update, and delete data in their database.  Functionality displayed in the walkthrough video below.
